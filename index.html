      <h1>Hi! I'm Kathryn, but I go by Katie :)</h1>
      <p>Originally from Vancouver, WA, I am now enjoying life in Seattle after getting my undergraduate
        degree at the University of Washington in Computer Science.</p>
      <p>My interests in CS encompass human-computer interaction, accessibility, education, and programming 
        languages. I love these areas and especially the opportunities when two or more areas intersect.

            creating welcoming spaces to build relationships during a virtual quarter.</li>
          <li>Students gave responses about how phrases like "I couldn't have explained that better" and slow 
            explanations helped develop a nonjudgemental learning environment. It reminded me of how inclusive 
            learning experiences are often the most impactful.</li>
          <li>Feedback from my professor helped me realize communication areas to improve upon and motivated me to 
            maintain my devotion to thorough preparation.</li>

            analysis of interviews.</li>
          <li>In addition to learning how inaccessible the world around me is, I learned what a truly inclusive lab 
            feels like. Despite inexperience, I received mentorship and support that helped me grow as a developer, team 
            member, and researcher to acheive goals of leading interviews, analyzing data, and dabbling in fabrication.</li>

            measures, and passing off the project after the internship. I had a lot of fun with designing webpage 
            structure, web admin roles, and simplified instruction videos for website maintenance in the future.</li>
